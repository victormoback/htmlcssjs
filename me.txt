my current knowledge in html css and js is on a scale from 1-10,
where 10 is "i created html, css and js" and 0 is "i have no idea what
these letter mean", i am maybe at a 4. or 3. 

Im very much looking forward to learn everything there is to know about these
techs, aswell as during these nine days learn how to webdevelop.
